              In this study, 7,606 playlist data were collected from the

              analysis on a unique panel data set that combines aggregate
              listener data for 12,000+ popular playlists with data on how
              prominently these playlists are featured in the Spotify app. We
              decompose demand for playlists into three major drivers: (i)
              time-invariant user preferences for playlists, (ii) users'
              responsiveness to featured playlists, and (iii) the popularity of
              tracks on a playlist. Our results demonstrate that users have
              strong preferences for playlists curated by Spotify, underscoring
              the importance of platform-curated playlists for stimulating
              consumption. Users also value featured playlists in the app,
              illustrating how Spotify can effectively guide attention to a
              selected set of playlists. In comparison, users respond weakly to
              the addition of popular tracks to playlists, pointing to a
              limited role of popular major label content in attracting
              listeners. Our demand estimates reveal that revenues of content
              suppliers asymmetrically depend on Spotify's decisions about
              playlist compositions and playlist featuring. We provide novel
              evidence for a much lower power of the major labels, and thus
              music producers more broadly, compared to Spotify. We conclude

               the popular YouTube mobile app as a test case. From a survey of

               stalking, cyberstalkers can use a wider range of methods, from
               tracking victims through social media to impersonating targeted
               individuals. To adequately address these crimes, lawmakers need
               to draft new laws specific to these offenses. Because
